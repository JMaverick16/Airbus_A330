# Emesary bridged transmitter for armament notifications.
# 
# Richard Harrison 2017
#
# NOTES:
# 1.The incoming bridges that is defined here will apply to all models that 
#   are loaded over MP; it is better to create the bridges here rather than in the model.xml
#   So given that we don't want a bridge on all MP models only those that are on OPRF
#   aircraft that want to receive notifications we will create the incoming bridge here
#   and thus only an OPRF model will receive notifications from another OPRF model.
#
# 2. The Emesary MP bridge requires two sides; the outgoing and incoming. 
#    - The outgoing aircraft will forwards all received notifications via MP;
#      and these will be received by a similarly equipped craft.
#    - The receiving aircraft will receive all notifications from other MP craft via
#      the globalTransmitter - which is bridged via property #18 /sim/multiplay/emesary/bridge[18]

# Setup the bridge
# armament notification 24 bytes
# geoEventNotification - 34 bytes + the length of the RemoteCallsign and Name fields.
#NOTE: due to bug in Emesary MP Bridge (fixed in 2019.2 after 24/3/2020) we can only
#      reliably send one message type per bridge - so for the maximum compatibility
#      we will use two bridges.
#      If at some point in the future we target 2019.2 as a min ver we can use a single
#      bridge and setup the notification list to contain all of the armament hit/flying notifications
#i.e. change to [notifications.ArmamentInFlightNotification.new(nil), notifications.ArmamentNotification.new(nil)];
